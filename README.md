Floodmap is a dynamic project designed to provide users with real-time visualizations of flood levels overlaid on Google Maps. With the ability to visualize flood-prone areas, users can make informed decisions regarding travel routes and understand road conditions during flood events. Empowering users to plan and navigate safely, Floodmap offers a crucial tool in mitigating the impacts of flooding on communities.
